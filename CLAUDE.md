## Production Catastrophe Lessons

**NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Full stories: `docs/incidents-2026-04-04.md`.

### 11. Subagent prompts must explicitly list what is FORBIDDEN, not just what is allowed
Every infrastructure-touching subagent prompt needs an explicit "DO NOT" section; positive instructions alone are insufficient.

### 12. E2E verification requires LIVE browser rendering on BOTH desktop and mobile
Code review, bundle grep, and curl are NEVER sufficient. Trigger content via UI, then verify the rendered result.

### 13. NEVER let a single subagent handle multiple tasks (multitask)
Each subagent invocation handles exactly ONE issue. Launch multiple subagents in parallel for multiple issues — never bundle.

### 14. Subagent rejected by hook MUST PAUSE + report. See Subagent Hook Discipline.

## 🔄 Auto-Commit Mechanism (refs/checkpoints/*)

Automated snapshots go to `refs/checkpoints/<branch>`; HEADs never advance. `/push` requires clean tree. Full ops: `docs/checkpoint-mechanism.md`.

## 🚨 Orchestrator-Only Rule

Main agent is the orchestrator; delegate real work to subagents. Enforced by `~/.claude/hooks/pretool-orchestrator-gate.py`.

- **Whitelist (always allowed)**: `Agent`, `TodoWrite`, `AskUserQuestion`, `Skill`, `CronCreate`, `CronDelete`, `CronList`, `ScheduleWakeup`, `mcp__happy__change_title`, `Bash`, `Read` (≤600 lines, capped by `~/.claude/hooks/pretool-read-size-guard.py`), `Glob`, `Grep`. `Bash` capped at 3 consecutive same-name calls.
- **Non-whitelist (`Edit`, `Write`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `NotebookEdit`, `EnterWorktree`, `ExitWorktree`, `mcp__playwright__*`, …)**: allowed once TOTAL per tool name per turn; intervening different tool calls do NOT reset the count; 2nd same-name call blocks regardless.
- **Permanently blocked**: `EnterPlanMode`, `ExitPlanMode` — even with `/do`.
- **Bypass**: user invokes `/do` this session → gate exits 0 for everything except permanently-blocked tools.
- Subagents (`agent_id` present) bypass all checks. Streak state at `/tmp/claude-tool-streak-<sid>.json`. For files >600 lines, delegate and ask for a summary — never request raw contents.

---

## Core Principles

- **Read before Edit**: always read files before modifying.
- **Cite locations**: provide file paths with line numbers (e.g., `src/index.ts:42`).
- **Parallel execution**: run independent tool calls in parallel.
- **TodoWrite**: track multi-step tasks.
- **Communication**: concise, technical, no emojis, accuracy over validation.

## 🚫 Safety Enforcement

Enforced by `~/.claude/hooks/pretool-bash-safety.sh` (PreToolUse). Hook is the authoritative source — see hook for exact patterns and triggers.

---

## 🛡️ Subagent Hook Discipline

**NON-NEGOTIABLE.** When a hook (PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Stop) rejects a command, the subagent MUST:

1. **PAUSE** immediately and report the rejected command + hook output to the user.
2. **NOT** circumvent via shell wrappers, intermediary scripts, hook-source recon, or hook-file edits.
3. If the task genuinely requires the rejected operation, output a **REQUEST** message to the user describing exactly what needs to run and why; the user decides.

---

## 🌙 Long-Running Process Verification

A subagent MUST NOT restart a long-running daemon it itself depends on to verify a change. Use one of: (1) sandboxed parallel daemon against a throwaway state dir; (2) static read of the post-build artifact; (3) PAUSE-PENDING-USER — output a REQUEST naming the restart command and stop.

---

## Security, Style, MCP & Web Search

- Secrets via environment variables / `.env`; never commit credentials. Validate and sanitize all user input. Apply least privilege. Keep dependencies patched.
- Match existing project style; respect linter/formatter config. Comments explain *why*, not *what*.
- Library/framework named by user → fetch Context7 docs before generating library-specific code.
- Multi-source research (5+ sources, site exploration, reflection): delegate to `@deep-search` (`/deep-search`, `/research-deep`, `/search-tree`, `/reflect-search`, `/site-navigate`). Simple 1-3 search queries: WebSearch directly.

---

## 🖥️ Server Infrastructure

Hetzner vServer (16 vCPU, 32GB RAM, 20GB swap) on Ubuntu. Full topology: `docs/server-infra.md`.

### Key Rules
- **NEVER** create containers with `docker run` — use `docker compose up -d` from `/root/deploy/`.
- **NEVER** stop/restart happy containers without explicit user approval (enforced by hook).

---

## 🚦 Orchestrator Prompt Purity

When dispatching a subagent via `Agent`, the prompt describes **WHAT** (problem, constraints, acceptance criteria) — not **HOW** (no tool names, shell commands, or shell syntax). The subagent picks its own toolchain.

Enforcement: `~/.claude/hooks/pretool-orchestrator-prompt-purity.py` (PreToolUse Agent matcher).

---

## 🔗 Nested .claude Repo

`/root/.claude` symlinks to `/dev/shm/dev-workspace/dot-claude` (separate git repo). For `.claude/*` commits, work inside that path — never push from `/root`. Full architecture: `docs/ramdisk-architecture.md`.
