# orphaned-agents

Archived agent definitions not currently referenced

---

## Purpose

This folder contains agent definition files that are not currently referenced by any slash command but may be useful for future reference or reintegration.

## Contents

- `git-edge-case-analyst.md` - Git history analysis specialist
  - Discovers development edge cases by analyzing commits, violations, and patterns
  - Not currently integrated into any command workflow
  - Archived on 2026-01-08 during cleanup
  - May be useful for future /dev or /test workflow enhancements

## Policy

**Review before use**

Orphaned agents were removed from active use for a reason:
- May be incomplete implementations
- May have been superseded by other agents
- May require updates to work with current workflow

Before reintegrating:
1. Review the agent definition for completeness
2. Test in isolation before adding to commands
3. Update documentation if reactivating

*This folder contains agent definitions preserved for potential future use.*
