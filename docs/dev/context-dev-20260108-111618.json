  "requirement": {
    "original": "两个任务，第一个任务检查为什么这么多非功能文件夹和文档没有被删除？第二个添加一个readme-updator加入到clean工作流中专门负责更新所有的readme，以反映最新的仓库变化",
    "clarified": "Task 1: Fix /clean workflow - cleanliness-inspector is NOT detecting non-functional folders (.bmad-core, .cursor, bin, examples, learning-materials, logs, skills_package, systemd, templates, tests). Task 2: Fix rule-inspector to always update READMEs with recent changes instead of only initializing once",
    "what": "Fix two critical issues in /clean workflow: (1) Add non-functional folder detection to cleanliness-inspector, (2) Make rule-inspector update READMEs on every run with freshness detection",
    "why": "User has 11 non-functional folders (totaling ~6MB) that were never detected by /clean. READMEs are outdated because rule-inspector only runs conditionally and never overwrites.",
