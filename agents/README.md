# agents

Specialized subagent definitions for orchestrated workflows

---

## Purpose

This folder contains markdown specifications for specialized subagents used in the /dev and /clean workflows. Each agent handles a specific phase of development or cleanup operations.

**Key agents**:
- `dev.md` - Main development orchestration agent
- `cleaner.md` - File organization and cleanup agent
- `qa.md` - Quality assurance and testing agent
- `rule-inspector.md` - Folder rule discovery and documentation
- `cleanliness-inspector.md` - Folder cleanliness validation
- `style-inspector.md` - Code style and naming validation
- `deep-search.md` - Advanced web research agent
- `artifact-generator.md` - Interactive artifact creation
- `file-processor.md` - Batch file processing
- `code-quality-auditor.md` - Code quality analysis

## Allowed File Types

**Only .md files** - Agent specifications in Markdown format

## Naming Convention

**kebab-case** (lowercase with hyphens)
- Examples: `rule-inspector.md`, `deep-search.md`, `qa.md`
- Exception: None - all files follow this pattern

## Organization Rules

1. **Flat structure** - All agent specs at root level, no subdirectories
2. **One agent per file** - Each .md file defines exactly one agent
3. **Standardized format** - All agents follow the template structure:
   - Role definition
   - Input/Output format (JSON)
   - Step-by-step workflow
   - Quality standards
   - Safety rules

## Standards

- All agent files must define JSON input/output interfaces
- Agents must specify numbered workflow steps
- Agents must include quality and safety sections
- Use clear, imperative language for instructions
