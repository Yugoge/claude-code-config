# sentinel-lint.sh - Guards the dev-registry sentinel anchor in orchestrator files
#
# Purpose: Verifies that the canonical REGISTRY_DIR assignment line — the anchor
# for the /dev subagent code-write enforcement injection — remains present in
# each of the three orchestrator files. If any file has lost the anchor, the
# script exits 1 with a clear error identifying the affected file. Exits 0
# silently when all anchors are present.
#
# Modes (auto-detected via $GIT_INDEX_FILE):
#   - Pre-commit (staged content):  $GIT_INDEX_FILE is set -> read via `git show :<path>`
#   - Standalone (disk content):    $GIT_INDEX_FILE is unset -> read files from disk
#
# Usage:
#   sentinel-lint.sh                 # standalone mode (disk files)
#   GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/index sentinel-lint.sh   # pre-commit mode (staged content)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = all three files contain the anchor
#   1 = one or more files are missing the anchor
#   2 = internal error (e.g. repo root not found in staged mode)
#
# Dependencies: bash, grep -F, git (only in staged mode).
# Must complete in <500ms on the current repo.
