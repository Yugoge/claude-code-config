# Emits exactly TWO compact lines (one per mount: /tmp and /dev/shm), derived from
# `df -h /tmp /dev/shm | tail -n +2` (column header stripped). Any mount whose
# Use% column exceeds 75% is prefixed with the literal `WARN ` (5 bytes including

# Non-blocking: exits 0 unconditionally regardless of df failures.
# `df` is invoked via PATH lookup (bare `df`) per project convention.
