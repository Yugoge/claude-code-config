# merge.sh - wrapper for /merge slash command
#
# Why this exists: pretool-git-privilege-guard.py raw-greps for the literal
# string "git" + space + "merge" in command text and rejects it unless the
# env var CLAUDE_MERGE_COMMAND_ACTIVE=1 is set in the hook's process env.
# main-agent shell never has that env set, so the inline checkout+merge
# pattern in merge.md was unrunnable from agent context. This wrapper runs
# the merge in its OWN subprocess (which does not go through main-agent
# PreToolUse), exporting the env var locally so the privilege-guard inside
# the subprocess admits the inner command.
#
# Sentinel check mirrors commit.sh/push.sh (2026-04-28 SlashCommand-bypass plug).

# Sentinel enforcement is handled by pretool-wrapper-userintent.py (PreToolUse hook)
# before this script runs. The wrapper itself stays pure git work.

Resolve manually, then re-invoke:

  2. <edit files to resolve conflicts>
  3. git add <files>
  4. git commit                # complete the merge commit
  5. /merge $BRANCH_NAME       # re-run via slash command to finish cleanup

The wrapper is idempotent: re-running after a clean merge skips re-merging
("Already up to date") and executes only the cleanup section.
