"""Resolve a /spec monolith path to its split-artifact id + paths (the canonical
spec-id resolver shared by /spec finalize and every /dev* consumer).

Why this exists (one-time migration note — convention flip ~2026-05-14..05-21):
  /spec writes the monolith FLAT at docs/dev/specs/spec-<ts>.md (WITH a `spec-`
  prefix) but substitutes a DE-PREFIXED <spec-id>=<ts> for the split artifacts
  (docs/dev/specs/<ts>/views/, .claude/specs/<ts>/). Older specs were emitted
  PREFIXED on disk (docs/dev/specs/spec-<ts>/views/). Consumers used to derive the
  spec-id by taking the monolith basename minus .md (which KEEPS the prefix), so
  new de-prefixed specs silently fell back to monolith mode. A naive strip would
  REGRESS the old prefixed specs. This helper is a TOLERANT resolver: it computes
  candidate ids [de_prefixed, raw_stem] and classifies each candidate's on-disk
  artifacts into exactly three states, then decides loudly.

THREE-STATE decision table (per candidate):
  ABSENT            -> no artifact evidence (no views dir / manifest / split marker)
  PRESENT-AND-VALID -> manifest valid JSON, schema_version==1, monolith_path
                       realpath/samefile == THIS monolith (anchored to project),
                       split marker present + fresh, all referenced views present
  PRESENT-BUT-INVALID -> has artifact evidence but fails ANY validity predicate

Decision:
  every candidate ABSENT      -> views_available=false, legacy monolith mode, EXIT 0
  exactly one PRESENT-AND-VALID (others ABSENT) -> artifact_id=that, EXIT 0
  any PRESENT-BUT-INVALID      -> FAIL LOUD (EXIT non-zero) — never silent monolith
  two PRESENT-AND-VALID         -> FAIL LOUD (EXIT non-zero) — ambiguous

Orphan cp-state under .claude/specs/<c>/ is NOT artifact evidence and never drives
ABSENT/VALID classification (protects Part A: a prefixed orphan cp-state must not
block resolution to the de-prefixed valid artifacts).

Usage:
  resolve-spec-artifacts.py --spec-path <monolith.md> --project-dir <root>
Output: machine-readable JSON on stdout.
Exit codes: 0 = resolved (single-valid OR all-absent legacy monolith mode)
            3 = PRESENT-BUT-INVALID (loud-fail 防线)
            4 = AMBIGUOUS (two valid manifests for one monolith)
