"""Line-precise (hunk-filtered) staging primitive — fail-closed.

Stages ONLY this cycle's owned hunks within a single already-authorized file,
leaving any peer (unattributed) hunks unstaged in the working tree. Ownership is
derived from dev's own authored content (the owned-edits ledger), NOT from a
file-state snapshot — so it is immune to peer timing/interleaving. A pre-edit
snapshot is used ONLY for a fail-closed out-of-owned-region cross-check.

Usage:
  stage-owned-hunks.py --git-root <root> --file <repo-rel-path> \
      --ledger <ledger.json> --snapshot <snapshot-file>

  --ledger    JSON file: list of {"old": "...", "new": "..."} owned edits for THIS
              file, in the order dev applied them. Line numbers (if present) are
              ADVISORY only and ignored by ownership logic.
  --snapshot  Path to a file holding the EXACT pre-edit (pre-first-edit) bytes of
              the worktree file (the cross-check trust anchor).

Exit codes:
  0   owned hunks staged (or empty owned diff -> no-op, nothing to stage)
  10  EXCLUDED (fail-closed) — ambiguity, peer entanglement, or apply reject.
      Reason printed to stderr. Caller MUST warn-and-skip (NEVER whole-file stage).
  2   hard/usage error (also treated as EXCLUDE by the caller)

Design invariant (PROCEED iff): the file is staged ONLY when reconstructing the
worktree with every owned range reverted to its recorded `old_string` yields bytes
BYTE-IDENTICAL to the pre-edit snapshot. Any unattributed byte change must occupy
either owned bytes (caught by the byte-match check) or non-owned bytes (caught by
the cross-check) -> EXCLUDE. There is no fail-open path.
