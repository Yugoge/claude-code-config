# Description: Emit a prompt-injection text block describing an agent's current rank/range
#              and last 3 behavioral history events, plus a role-specific tail phrase.
# Usage: score-inject.sh --agent <name> [--lifecycle-file <path>]
# Output: stdout = injection text block (rank + range + last-3 events + tail phrase)
#         stderr = empty on success
# Exit codes: 0 = ok, 1 = bad argument or malformed JSONL
#
# Root cause ref: arch-7 phase 2 (task 20260525-050824) — switched read path from
# agent-scores.json to logs/lifecycle.jsonl under shared flock.
