# Deprecated Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer active but preserved for reference.

## Purpose

Documents are moved here when they:
- Are superseded by newer versions
- Were temporary implementation plans (now completed)
- Contain outdated information that should not be confused with current docs
- Have historical value for understanding project evolution

## Naming Convention

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md`

Example: `2025-10-26-phase2-implementation-plan.md`
