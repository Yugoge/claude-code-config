## 🎯 Current State Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **Solid Architecture**: Commands, agents, data layers well-designed
✅ **Innovative Learning**: Socratic dialogue approach (not passive flashcards)
✅ **RemNote-style Organization**: Hierarchical + bidirectional linking
✅ **SM-2 Foundation**: Working spaced repetition system
✅ **Universal Q&A**: analyst agent replaces Claude.ai web interface
✅ **Conversation Archival**: Knowledge extraction from dialogues

### Gaps Identified

**Foundation Incomplete** (from pr.plan.md):
- ❌ Missing `.claude/settings.json` with safety hooks
- ❌ No `knowledge-base/.taxonomy.json` (ISCED + Dewey)
- ❌ Rebuild scripts not implemented (`rebuild-backlinks.py`, etc.)
- ❌ Conversation index schema inconsistencies
- ❌ `/kb-init` not fully hardened

**Technology Lag**:
- ❌ Using SM-2 while FSRS is now industry standard (Anki adopted 2023)
- ❌ No memory persistence (vs. Claude MCP capabilities 2025)
- ❌ Missing knowledge graph visualization (standard in competitors)
- ❌ No learning analytics (data-driven optimization missing)
- ❌ Static difficulty (vs. adaptive AI tutoring trend)

**Ecosystem Gaps**:
- ❌ Desktop-only (no mobile learning)
- ❌ Limited export options (no Anki, PDF, RemNote migration)
- ❌ Manual Git operations (no automated sync)
