## ‚ö° Extended Thinking Configuration

**Budget**: 20,000+ tokens (maximum reasoning depth)
**Mode**: Deep exploration with exhaustive analysis
**Approach**: Multi-path reasoning with recursive refinement

---

## üéØ Deep Reasoning Protocol

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Problem Analysis (5000 tokens)
- Break down the problem into fundamental components
- Identify all assumptions, constraints, and requirements
- Map dependencies and relationships
- Generate multiple problem interpretations
- Evaluate each interpretation for validity

### Phase 2: Solution Space Exploration (7000 tokens)
- Generate 5-10 distinct solution approaches
- For each approach, explore:
  - Implementation complexity
  - Performance characteristics
  - Maintainability implications
  - Edge cases and failure modes
  - Trade-offs and limitations
- Rank solutions by multiple criteria
- Identify hybrid approaches combining best elements

### Phase 3: Deep Dive Implementation Planning (5000 tokens)
- Select optimal solution(s) based on analysis
- Create detailed step-by-step execution plan
- Anticipate obstacles and prepare contingencies
- Design verification and validation strategy
- Document reasoning chain for transparency

### Phase 4: Recursive Refinement (3000 tokens)
- Review entire reasoning chain
- Identify weak points or assumptions
- Challenge conclusions with counter-arguments
- Refine plan based on self-critique
- Ensure coherence and completeness
