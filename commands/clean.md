# Clean Command Orchestrator

Aggressive project cleanup and normalization with orchestrated multi-agent workflow.

---

## Philosophy

Enforce strict organization standards through systematic inspection and selective cleanup.

---

## Orchestrator Rules -- DO NOT

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violating any of them is a critical workflow failure.**

The orchestrator (the LLM executing this command) MUST NOT:

1. **DO NOT use Edit, Write, or Bash tools to execute cleanup actions.** All file modifications during cleanup execution (Step 16) MUST be performed by the cleaner subagent, invoked via the Agent tool. The orchestrator coordinates; it does not execute.

2. **DO NOT subjectively filter or narrow scope when the user selects "Execute all".** "Execute all" means every finding from the combined report becomes an approved action. The orchestrator has zero discretion to classify findings as "not in scope", "minor", or "not worth doing". If the inspectors found it, it gets approved.

3. **DO NOT dismiss findings as "minor" or "not in scope" in aggressive mode.** When the user selects Option 1 (Execute all / aggressive), severity classification is irrelevant for approval purposes. All critical, major, AND minor findings are approved without exception.

4. **DO NOT build approval JSONs manually when Option 1 is selected.** The approvals must be mechanically generated from the combined report -- one approved_action per finding, no omissions, no editorial judgment.

5. **DO NOT execute any file modifications directly at any step.** The orchestrator's tools for cleanup execution are limited to the Agent tool (to invoke the cleaner subagent). This applies to Steps 11-12. Reading files and writing JSON coordination documents (docs/clean/) is permitted.

**Root cause reference**: On 2026-04-05, the orchestrator violated rules 1, 2, and 3 -- it used Edit/Write tools directly for cleanup and reduced 92 inspector findings to 32 approved actions when the user selected "Execute all (aggressive)". 60 findings were skipped with excuses like "not in scope" and "minor severity".

---

## Workflow Overview

This command orchestrates three specialized subagents:

1. **cleanliness-inspector**: Detects file organization issues
2. **style-inspector**: Audits development standards compliance
3. **cleaner**: Executes approved cleanup actions

All agents communicate via JSON in `docs/clean/`.

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Workflow

**Parse `--codex`**: If `$ARGUMENTS` contains the literal token `--codex`, strip it from the arguments and set `codex_required = true`. Otherwise set `codex_required = false` (default). When `codex_required = true`, every cleanliness-inspector and style-inspector dispatch prompt below MUST include the literal line `codex_required: true` so the subagent's opt-in codex consultation block activates. When `codex_required = false`, omit that line.

Load TodoList checklist: activate venv and run `~/.claude/scripts/todo/clean.py`.

Set up working directory: create `docs/clean/`, generate `REQUEST_ID="clean-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"` and `TIMESTAMP` in ISO-8601 format.

**Documentation Structure Rules**:

Root directory .md files:
- **ALLOWED**: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md (official Claude Code files, do not move)
- **MOVE TO docs/**: All other .md files in project root

docs/ subdirectory structure:
- `docs/guides/` - User guides, tutorials, how-to documents
- `docs/reference/` - Technical docs, API reference, registries
- `docs/planning/` - Planning docs, roadmaps, design proposals
- `docs/reports/` - Completion reports, summaries, QA reports
- `docs/archive/YYYY-MM/` - Historical docs (by last modified month)
- `docs/dev/` - Development workflow JSONs only (no .md files)
- `docs/clean/` - Clean workflow JSONs only (no .md files)
- `docs/INDEX.md` - Auto-generated index (created by cleaner agent)

### Step 2: Scan Project Structure

Detect project type and gather baseline info: run `~/.claude/scripts/scan-project.sh "$PROJECT_ROOT"` and extract `project_type`, `file_counts.total`, `.docs`, `.scripts`, `.tests` from the JSON output.

### Step 3: Build Inspection Context

Create comprehensive JSON context for inspectors:

```json
{
  "request_id": "clean-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "orchestrator": {
    "requirement": "Inspect project for file organization issues and development standards violations",
    "analysis": {
      "project_root": "/absolute/path/to/project",
      "project_type": "Python|Node.js|Go|Generic",
      "constraints": [
        "preserve functional files",
        "safety first - never delete without confirmation",
        "archive docs rather than delete"
      ]
    }
  },
  "full_context": {
    "codebase_state": {
      "git_status": "output of git status",
      "current_branch": "branch name",
      "recent_commits": ["commit log"]
    },
    "directory_structure": "tree output or ls -R",
    "file_counts": {
      "total": 0,
      "docs": 0,
      "scripts": 0,
      "tests": 0
    }
  },
  "parameters": {
    "docs_directory": "docs/",
    "scripts_directory": "scripts/",
    "tests_directory": "tests/"
  }
}
```

Save to: `docs/clean/context-{REQUEST_ID}.json`

### Step 4: Rule Inspection and README Updates

**CRITICAL**: This step MUST execute BEFORE Step 5 on EVERY /clean run.

Run rule-inspector to update folder documentation with recent changes:

1. Discover all folders: `~/.claude/scripts/discover-folders.sh "$PROJECT_ROOT"`
2. Run freshness check: `~/.claude/scripts/check-readme-freshness.sh "$PROJECT_ROOT"` and save to `docs/clean/freshness-${REQUEST_ID}.json`
3. Build rule-inspector context JSON at `docs/clean/rule-context-${REQUEST_ID}.json` including request_id, timestamp, project_root, folders, freshness data, and parameters `freshness_check: true`, `update_stale_readmes: true`
4. Invoke: `~/.claude/scripts/orchestrator.sh rule-inspect "$RULE_CONTEXT"`
5. Verify `docs/clean/rule-context-${REQUEST_ID}.json` exists; abort with error if not
6. For each stale folder, verify the README was actually modified after the script start time; warn if not

**What this step does**:
- Analyzes Git history for ALL folders (including root directory)
- Checks README freshness (compares README mtime vs folder content mtime)
- Updates stale READMEs (> 7 days old: full update, 3-7 days: incremental)
- **Special handling for root documentation files (README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Checks against structural changes, updates project-level overview (not folder rules)
- Creates README for folders that lack one
- Regenerates INDEX.md with current file inventory
- Applies recency weighting (recent commits weighted 3x higher)

**Root documentation special processing** (ref: commit 590881d5 fix):
- Root `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` describe entire project structure, not folder-specific rules
- Freshness check compares against last structural change (new folders, archived folders, major commits)
- Update triggers when structural changes > 7 days old compared to documentation files
- README preserves user-written sections (Installation, Quick Start, Features), only regenerates Structure and Git Analysis
- ARCHITECTURE preserves user-written sections (Design Principles), only regenerates Directory Structure, Data Flow, and Git Analysis
- Different templates from subfolder READMEs (project overview, not organization rules)

**Verification**: Before proceeding to Step 5, you MUST confirm:
- ✅ Rule inspection completed (rule-context JSON exists)
- ✅ READMEs updated or confirmed fresh

**Root cause reference**: This fixes the issue from commands/clean.md lines 151-188 where rule-inspector only ran conditionally (NEEDS_INIT check), causing READMEs to become stale as repository evolved. Now runs on EVERY execution with freshness detection.

---

### Step 5: Invoke Cleanliness Inspector

Delegate to cleanliness-inspector subagent. The dispatch prompt MUST include:

```
Context file: docs/clean/context-{REQUEST_ID}.json
<If codex_required = true, include the literal next line; otherwise omit it>
codex_required: true
```

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/orchestrator.sh clean-inspect docs/clean/context-{REQUEST_ID}.json
```

Cleanliness inspector reads context, performs inspection, writes:
- `docs/clean/cleanliness-report-{REQUEST_ID}.json`

Expected output structure:

```json
{
  "request_id": "clean-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "inspector": "cleanliness-inspector",
  "findings": {
    "misplaced_docs": [],
    "naming_violations": [],
    "archive_candidates": [],
    "dev_context_files": [],
    "temp_files": [],
    "duplicate_scripts": [],
    "duplicate_tests": [],
    "non_functional_files": []
  },
  "summary": {
    "total_issues": 0,
    "critical": 0,
    "major": 0,
    "minor": 0,
    "estimated_space_saved": "XX MB"
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Invoke Style Inspectors (Parallel Multi-Agent)

The style-inspector uses a **budget protocol** to avoid context overflow. Instead of looping sequentially, the orchestrator plans the inspection upfront and launches ALL inspector agents in parallel, one per file group.

**Plan file**: `docs/clean/style-plan-{REQUEST_ID}.json`
**Partial reports**: `docs/clean/style-partial-{REQUEST_ID}-group{N}.json`
**Final report**: `docs/clean/style-report-{REQUEST_ID}.json`

#### Step 7: Plan Style Inspection

Run the planner script to discover all auditable files and split them into groups: `~/.claude/scripts/plan-style-inspection.sh "$PROJECT_ROOT"`. Save to `docs/clean/style-plan-${REQUEST_ID}.json`. Extract `agent_count` and `total_files` from the output.

Log: "Style inspection planned: {AGENT_COUNT} agents for {TOTAL_FILES} files"

If AGENT_COUNT is 0, skip to Step 11 (no files to audit).

#### Step 8: Launch Parallel Style Inspectors

For EACH group in the plan JSON, launch a style-inspector agent using the **Agent tool** with `run_in_background: true`. All agents MUST be launched in a SINGLE message (parallel, not sequential).

Each agent's prompt MUST contain:

```
You are a style-inspector. Audit ONLY the files listed below against all 11 development standards.

Request ID: {REQUEST_ID}
Group ID: {N}
Project root: {PROJECT_ROOT}
Context file: docs/clean/context-{REQUEST_ID}.json
<If codex_required = true, include the literal next line; otherwise omit it>
codex_required: true

Files to audit (audit EVERY file in this list, no others):
1. {file_path_1}
2. {file_path_2}
3. {file_path_3}
4. {file_path_4}
5. {file_path_5}

Write your partial report to: docs/clean/style-partial-{REQUEST_ID}-group{N}.json

The partial report MUST use this schema:
{
  "request_id": "{REQUEST_ID}",
  "group_id": {N},
  "files_audited": ["list of files you actually audited"],
  "violations": [
    {
      "standard": "standard-name",
      "severity": "critical",
      "location": "file:line",
      "finding": "description",
      "recommendation": "how to fix"
    }
  ],
  "status": "complete"
}

You MUST read each file fully before auditing it. Check all 11 standards against each file.
Your audit scope is exactly the files listed above. After auditing all of them, treat this as `STATUS: complete` for this invocation.
```

After launching all agents, log: "Launched {AGENT_COUNT} style-inspector agents in parallel"

#### Step 9: Collect and Merge Results

After ALL agents complete, read each partial report file:

```
docs/clean/style-partial-{REQUEST_ID}-group1.json
docs/clean/style-partial-{REQUEST_ID}-group2.json
...
docs/clean/style-partial-{REQUEST_ID}-group{N}.json
```

Merge all violations from every partial report into a single combined list. Merge all files_audited lists into a single deduplicated list. Write the final merged report to `docs/clean/style-report-{REQUEST_ID}.json`.

#### Step 10: Coverage Verification (MANDATORY GATE)

Read the plan file `docs/clean/style-plan-{REQUEST_ID}.json` and extract the `all_files` array. Compare it against the merged `files_audited` list from Step 9.

If ANY file from `all_files` is missing from the merged `files_audited`:

1. Log which files were missed and their count
2. Build a new group containing ONLY the missed files
3. Launch a targeted style-inspector agent for the missed files (same prompt format as Step 8, including `codex_required: true` when `codex_required = true`)
4. After the targeted agent completes, merge its results into the final report
5. Repeat coverage check -- if files are still missing after one retry, log an error and proceed

**BLOCK Step 11 until coverage verification passes** (all files in the plan appear in files_audited) OR the retry has been attempted.

---

Expected final output structure:

```json
{
  "request_id": "clean-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "inspector": "style-inspector",
  "violations": [
    {
      "standard": "standard-name",
      "severity": "critical",
      "location": "file:line",
      "finding": "description",
      "recommendation": "how to fix"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "standards_checked": 11,
    "violations_found": 0,
    "critical": 0,
    "files_audited": 0,
    "files_total": 0,
    "rounds_completed": 0
  }
}
```

### Step 11: Merge Inspection Reports

Combine both reports using orchestrator: `~/.claude/scripts/orchestrator.sh clean-merge-reports docs/clean/context-with-reports-{REQUEST_ID}.json`

Orchestrator merges and writes:
- `docs/clean/combined-report-{REQUEST_ID}.json`

### Step 12: Present Combined Report to User

Format and display findings:

```markdown
# Cleanup Analysis Report

**Project**: <project_name>
**Type**: <project_type>
**Generated**: <timestamp>

## File Organization Issues (Cleanliness Inspector)

### Critical Issues: X
- <critical findings>

### Major Issues: Y
- <major findings>

### Minor Issues: Z
- <minor findings>

## Development Standards Violations (Style Inspector)

### Critical Violations: X
- <critical violations>

### Major Violations: Y
- <major violations>

### Minor Violations: Z
- <minor violations>

## Summary

- Total issues: X
- Estimated space to free: XX MB
- Files to move: Y
- Files to archive: Z
- Files to delete: W
- Style fixes: V

## Cleanup Options

1. Execute all recommended actions (aggressive)
2. Execute only file organization (conservative)
3. Execute only critical/major issues
4. Review and approve individually (interactive)
5. Cancel and generate report only
```

### Step 13: Collect User Approval

Based on user selection, build approval context:

**Option 1: Execute all (aggressive) -- MECHANICAL GENERATION**

When the user selects Option 1, the orchestrator MUST mechanically generate the approvals JSON by iterating ALL findings from the combined report. There is no manual curation, no editorial filtering, no severity-based exclusion.

Procedure:
1. Read `docs/clean/combined-report-{REQUEST_ID}.json`
2. Extract every finding from `findings` (cleanliness) and `violations` (style)
3. For EACH finding, create one entry in `approved_actions` with `"approved": true`
4. Set `rejected_actions` to an empty array
5. Record `total_issues_in_report` (from combined report summary `total_issues`)
6. Record `total_approved_actions` (count of `approved_actions` array)
7. These two counts MUST be equal. If they differ, the generation has a bug -- do NOT proceed

```json
{
  "request_id": "clean-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "mode": "execute_all",
  "user_approvals": {
    "total_issues_in_report": 92,
    "total_approved_actions": 92,
    "approved_actions": [
      {
        "action_id": "finding_1",
        "source_report": "cleanliness|style",
        "source_finding_index": 0,
        "action": "move|delete|archive|fix",
        "description": "copied from finding",
        "location": "file:line or file path",
        "approved": true
      }
    ],
    "rejected_actions": []
  }
}
```

**Option 2: File organization only** (approve cleanliness findings, skip style)

**Option 3: Critical/major only** (filter by severity)

**Option 4: Interactive** (ask for each action)

**Option 5: Report only** (skip to completion report)

For Options 2-4, the orchestrator may apply the stated filter (by report type, severity, or individual user decision). Only Option 1 requires mechanical all-inclusive generation.

Save to: `docs/clean/user-approvals-{REQUEST_ID}.json`

### Step 14: Verify Cleanup Completeness (Option 1 Only)

**This gate is MANDATORY when the user selected Option 1 (Execute all). Skip for Options 2-5.**

Before proceeding to Step 15, the orchestrator MUST verify that the approvals JSON is complete:

1. Read `total_issues` from `docs/clean/combined-report-{REQUEST_ID}.json` summary section
2. Read `total_approved_actions` from `docs/clean/user-approvals-{REQUEST_ID}.json`
3. Compare the two counts

**If counts match**: Log "Completeness gate PASSED: {total_approved_actions} approved actions match {total_issues} combined report findings" and proceed to Step 15.

**If counts do NOT match**: BLOCK execution immediately. Do NOT proceed to Step 15 or Step 16. Log the following error:

```
COMPLETENESS GATE FAILED
Mode: execute_all
Combined report total_issues: {N}
Approved actions count: {M}
Discrepancy: {N - M} findings missing from approvals
ACTION: Regenerate approvals JSON from combined report. Every finding must have a corresponding approved_action.
```

The orchestrator MUST regenerate the approvals JSON (return to Step 13 Option 1 procedure) and re-run this gate. Do NOT bypass the gate or proceed with mismatched counts.

**Root cause reference**: On 2026-04-05, the orchestrator generated 32 approved actions from 92 combined findings. This gate would have blocked execution and forced regeneration.

---

### Step 15: Create Safety Checkpoint

Before execution, create a safety checkpoint on `refs/checkpoints/<branch>`
(NOT on HEAD — preserves git blame hygiene). The checkpoint-core library
handles the no-changes case (exit 0) and uses an isolated temp index so
your real staged area is untouched.

Run `bash ~/.claude/hooks/checkpoint.sh "Before /clean aggressive cleanup"`. Then read `refs/checkpoints/<branch>` and record the checkpoint commit via `~/.claude/scripts/orchestrator.sh record-checkpoint docs/clean/context-with-reports-{REQUEST_ID}.json "$CHECKPOINT_COMMIT"`.

**Rollback**: The checkpoint lives on a detached ref, not as a HEAD
ancestor. To recover individual files:
`git checkout refs/checkpoints/$(git branch --show-current) -- <path>`
For a full-tree reset (destructive, prefer file-level):
`git reset --hard refs/checkpoints/$(git branch --show-current)`

### Step 16: Invoke Cleaner with Approvals (DELEGATION ONLY)

**The orchestrator MUST delegate ALL cleanup execution to the cleaner subagent via the Agent tool. The orchestrator does NOT execute any file modifications itself.**

**DO NOT -- the following are FORBIDDEN during Step 16:**
- **DO NOT use the Edit tool** to modify any project files
- **DO NOT use the Write tool** to create or overwrite any project files
- **DO NOT use the Bash tool** to run commands that modify files (mv, cp, rm, sed, etc.)
- **DO NOT use any tool other than Agent** for cleanup execution
- **The ONLY tool permitted for cleanup execution is the Agent tool** (to invoke the cleaner subagent)

The orchestrator may use Bash to prepare the context JSON (merging approvals), but MUST NOT use Bash/Edit/Write to make any changes to project files.

Prepare context for the cleaner subagent:

```bash
jq -s '.[0] * {user_approvals: .[1].user_approvals}' \
  docs/clean/context-with-reports-{REQUEST_ID}.json \
  docs/clean/user-approvals-{REQUEST_ID}.json \
  > docs/clean/context-with-approvals-{REQUEST_ID}.json
```

Invoke the cleaner subagent using the Agent tool:

The orchestrator MUST use the Agent tool with the cleaner subagent prompt. The cleaner subagent reads `docs/clean/context-with-approvals-{REQUEST_ID}.json`, executes ALL approved actions, and writes its execution report.

```
Agent tool invocation:
  prompt: "You are the cleaner subagent.

Read these report files directly from the filesystem:
- Combined report: docs/clean/combined-report-{REQUEST_ID}.json
- Style report: docs/clean/style-report-{REQUEST_ID}.json
- Cleanliness report: docs/clean/cleanliness-report-{REQUEST_ID}.json
- User approvals: docs/clean/user-approvals-{REQUEST_ID}.json

The merged context with approvals is at: docs/clean/context-with-approvals-{REQUEST_ID}.json

Execute ALL approved_actions. Write results to docs/clean/cleanup-execution-{REQUEST_ID}.json."
```

The orchestrator MUST NOT supplement, assist, or "help" the cleaner by making additional edits. If the cleaner fails on specific actions, those failures are recorded in the execution report -- the orchestrator does not retry them directly.

Cleaner reads approvals, executes actions, writes:
- `docs/clean/cleanup-execution-{REQUEST_ID}.json`

Expected output structure:

```json
{
  "request_id": "clean-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "cleaner": {
    "status": "completed|partial|blocked",
    "actions_completed": [],
    "actions_failed": [],
    "actions_skipped": [],
    "summary": {
      "total_actions": 10,
      "successful": 8,
      "failed": 0,
      "skipped": 2,
      "files_moved": 3,
      "files_archived": 2,
      "files_deleted": 3,
      "space_freed": "15 MB"
    },
    "git_status": {
      "checkpoint_commit": "abc123",
      "cleanup_commit": "def456",
      "files_staged": 8,
      "ready_for_review": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 17: Verify Cleanup Results

Review git changes: check `git status` and `git diff --stat HEAD~1` to confirm expected files were staged and committed.

Present verification summary:

```markdown
# Cleanup Execution Results

**Status**: <completed|partial|blocked>
**Actions**: X successful, Y failed, Z skipped

## Changes Made

- Moved X files to correct locations
- Archived Y old documents
- Deleted Z temp files
- Fixed W style violations
- Updated .gitignore

## Git Status

- Checkpoint commit: <hash>
- Cleanup commit: <hash>
- Files changed: X
- Ready for review: Yes

## Next Steps

1. Review changes: `git diff HEAD~1`
2. If satisfied: Changes already committed — to publish to remote: run `/push`
3. If not satisfied: `git reset --hard <checkpoint_commit>`
4. See detailed report: docs/clean/completion-{REQUEST_ID}.md
```

### Step 18: Generate Completion Report

Create comprehensive completion report:

Save to: `docs/clean/completion-{REQUEST_ID}.md`

```markdown
# Cleanup Completion Report

**Request ID**: clean-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
**Project**: <project_path>
**Type**: <project_type>
**Executed**: <timestamp>
**Status**: <completed|partial|blocked>

**Root Cause**: Project files evolved organically without consistent organization standards. Manual cleanup was error-prone and time-consuming.

**Solution**: Implemented orchestrated multi-agent cleanup workflow with automated detection, user approval, and safe execution.

**Next Steps**: Run /clean periodically to maintain organization standards.
