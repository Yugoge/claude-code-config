# Extended Thinking Mode

**Task**: $*

## Thinking Level: $1

Enable extended thinking with the following parameters:

**Thinking Budget**:
- `think`: 2,048 tokens (standard complex reasoning)
- `think hard`: 5,000 tokens (detailed analysis)
- `think harder`: 10,000 tokens (deep exploration)
- `ultrathink`: 20,000+ tokens (maximum depth reasoning)

## ðŸ§  Activation Protocol

Before responding, I will:

1. **Deep Analysis Phase** (spend thinking budget on):
   - Problem decomposition
   - Multiple solution paths exploration
   - Edge case identification
   - Trade-off evaluation

2. **Planning Phase**:
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - Dependency mapping
   - Risk assessment

3. **Execution Phase**:
   - Implement with careful consideration
   - Validate each step
   - Document reasoning

## ðŸ“‹ Task Breakdown

I will now engage extended thinking mode to thoroughly analyze and solve:
